# countdown

Ever been so bored at work that you start writing a script that counts down the number of seconds left in the day?

Ever miss the good old days where blink tags roamed freely across the internet?

I present to you the greatest combination of those things that will ever be used on your computer.

Assuming you have a decent computer that runs Linux, with bash, and GNU's date, not that stinky BSD date that runs on Macs (boo!) or (gasp) BSD variants, in which case you will need to install `gdate` and alias it appropriately, then all you need to do is clone this repo, chmod a+x countdown.sh, then ./countdown.sh and behold at the wonder that you have found.
